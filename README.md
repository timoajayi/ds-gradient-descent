# Gradient Descent

The objective of ANY Machine Learning Model is to find parameters, weights or a structure that minimizes the Cost function.

A way to minimize the Cost function is Gradient Descent. We want to dive deep into this very basic ML method and try to understand Gradient Descent on a very granular level.
